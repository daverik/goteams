					<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
					<p class='abstract-text'>
						Today, running GöteborgsVarvet is a solitary activity. For this reason, some people find it hard to be motivated to train before the race, and complete it. It is also difficult for spectators to know what is happening during the race. LagVarvet is a proposed concept for GöteborgsVarvet which help runners to stay motivated to come prepared to the race and lastly pass the finish line. LagVarvet allows runners to run in teams of friends at school or the workplace, or even to run for large organisations or other causes. The greatest values from team sports are captured and put into the context of a traditionally individual competition. GöteborgsVarvet has never been this fun.

						<h1>Why?</h1>
						<div class='line'></div>
					</div>
					<p class='center par'>
						Today, running GöteborgsVarvet is a solitary activity. For this reason, some people find it hard to be motivated to train before the race, and complete it. It is also difficult for spectators to know what is happening during the race, as the current visualization feels outdated and unimaginative.
					</p>
					<div class='center'>
						<h1>What?</h1>
						<div class='line'></div>
					</div>
					<p class='center par'>
						LagVarvet is a proposed concept for GöteborgsVarvet which help runners to stay motivated to run the race and eventually complete it. This service allows runners to run for a team and compete against other teams. Each runner can create teams or manage the teams they will  run for, but also socialize with team mates and other competitors before the race. Additionally, users can run for larger organizations or causes, such as running for the city of Göteborg, their working place, or their favourite football team. Foremost, the project is targeted towards small groups of friends or colleagues that need means to stay motivated to run prior to the day of the event.
					</p>
					<div class='center'>
						<h1>How?</h1>
						<div class='line'></div>
					</div>
					<p class='center par'>
						This project is realized through a website. The service captures the greatest values from team activities and put them into the context of a traditionally individually focused competition. New values such as team spirit and community-feeling will create new means for runners to participate and perform well on the day of the race. Even spectators of the race will find great value from using the website by interacting with the real-time updated interactive race visualization. At the day of the race, spectators can in an informative and fun way get information about LagVarvet runners, such as their current location, running speed and estimated finish time. The visualization is also thought to be presented on the large tv-screens along the race track - for the on-site audience to watch.

					<div class='center'>
						<p class='light bigger'>
							The project follows a design process that has a foundation in human centered design. User requirements have been elicited from interviews with potential users, from which the ideation process is based on.

						<h1 class='light'>Reward system</h1>
						<div class='line light'></div>
						<p class='light par'>
							To enhance the level of competition among the teams, there is a reward system connected to each runners’ performance in the race. Fast runners earn more points than slower runners, but everyone contribute to their team in terms of points. The reward system is carefully designed to not only favor teams with the most number of runners.
						</p>
						<h1 class='light'>Private or Public Teams</h1>
						<div class='line light'></div>
						<p class='light par'>
							Teams are either private or public. The private teams are meant for small groups close friends that will not feel uncomfortable with sharing personal information as name, age, race information or what teams they support. In public teams no personal details will be shared except for name of the runners and the amount of points they contribute with.
						</p>
						<h1 class='light'>Leagues</h1>
						<div class='line light'></div>
						<p class='light par'>
							To facilitate competition and rivalry among teams, leagues can be created. For instance, one league can consist of all the universities in Sweden or the most popular companies.
